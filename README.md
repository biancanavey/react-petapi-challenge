# Technical Assessment Practice - Building a React App

In this task you need to build a React app which a user can use to view a list of pets and to add a new pet to the list. You will not have access to the code for the API - it is hosted remotely and can't be edited.

## Requirements

- Use `create-react-app` to set up the basic structure
- The user must be able to see a list of all pets already in the database
- The user must be able to add a new pet to the database and see it on the list
- Push your code to a GitHub repository
- Your submission should include a README file (use the one created for, just replace the content with your own) which describes the installation/startup process for your app.

## Considerations

- The route to use for your requests is `https://mysterious-savannah-90061.herokuapp.com/pets`. It will accept GET and POST requests. Because Heroku limits the connection speed available to inactive apps it may take a few seconds to load the first time, but should speed up after.
- You will need to investigate the API using either Postman or a browser in order to see how the JSON is structured.
- It's up to you to decide if you want to use class-based components, functional components or both.
- This task is about building a React app, CSS isn't important. That said, if you have time and want to style it feel free!
- Everyone will be using the same API, meaning you will likely see new pets showing up when you refresh your app
- Remember to use Git effectively. Committing little and often will give the reviewer a better picture of how you went about building the app and also give you a bigger safety net if you need to roll anything back.

## Submission

There is no hard deadline for submission as we know that you'll be working on this at the same time as other things and may need to step away from it for a while. However, completeing it in advance of your interview so there is time to get some feedback would be advised. 

This is an **individual activity**. When you have finished send your GitHub link to Colin via Discord and you'll get feedback on it before your interview.
